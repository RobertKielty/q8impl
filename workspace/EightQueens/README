Java code that implments a solution to the Eight Queens puzzle 

see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

Written using Eclipse, managed on a local Git repository, I implemented tests using JUnit3 as I designed the code yesterday.

This morning I added more tests and then ran a code checker called PMD across the code to improve its quality. I have implemented a lot of its recommendations on the non-test code.

PMD has highlighted one breach of encapsulation within the EightQueensChessBoard class which I would seek to address if this were code headed for a production environment.
